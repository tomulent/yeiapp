    <p>The Youth Empowerment Institute is an ongoing project designed, staffed, and implemented by students of the <a href="#giip">Global Information Internship Program</a>, which is an honors program at UCSC. YEI is free of charge and open to students at <a href="#wtec">Watsonville TEC</a></p>
      
    <p>YEI is a 5 day and night summer camp held at the UCSC campus. Our campers stay in dorms and eat in the dining halls. We work on two things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>College Workshops</h3>
            <p>Campers learn about the ins and outs of college; how to apply, what to look for, and how to get financial aid.</p>
      </li>

      <li><h3>Mobile App Programming</h3>
             <p>We teach the creation of mobile apps using HTML and jQuery Mobile. These sound very complicated but are actually very simple. Students come in with zero knowledge of coding and leave producing apps like the one you are using now.</p><p>We want to make clear that anyone can learn to do this and in a very short period of time.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

		<h4>How to Apply for College</h4>
			<p>The following comes from WikiHow. Click <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Apply-to-College" target="_blank">here</a> <img src="content-images/nw16.png" class="nw" /> for original article.</p>
    <div data-role="collapsible"><!--From wiki how-->
		  <h4>Steps 1-14</h4>
	      <p>1. Understand that there is a college for every student who wants to go. The USA has 4000 degree-granting institutions. Almost all of them accept the majority of applicants, only a small number of elite schools accept less than half the people who apply. Hundreds of colleges accept almost everyone who applies. So, you are definitely getting into college if you want to go.</p>
		
  	    <p>2. On the other hand, top schools like Harvard, Stanford, Duke, University of Chicago, etc. receive thousands of applications from top students for their Freshman classes. It is important to have a realistic view of what your credentials are and what those schools require. Try to match your own grades and special abilities with the standards for the school you want to attend.</p>

	      <p>3. During your junior year, move to finish any requirements needed to apply to certain colleges. Some colleges will want you to complete calculus and statistics before you apply; others will stress a broad range of humanities classes. Be sure that you have an idea of the colleges you might want to apply to, and start meeting their class requirements, if necessary.</p>

	      <p>4.Successfully complete high school or an academic  equivalent (such as a GED). People who move on to higher education have many different educational backgrounds. Among community college students in the United States, 43% are age 21 or younger, 42% are ages 22-39 and 16% are 40 or older. Your age should not be a negative factor in applying to college.</p>

	      <p>5. Take the SAT or ACT test because about 85% of colleges require one or the other for first-year students. Nearly all schools will take either one, but a few schools will only accept one or the other, so check the school website to see if they are picky or not.</p>

	      <p>6. Use college and scholarship search sites to your advantage. Look at colleges that have features that interest you, such as ideal major, class size, location, and the like. Check out their websites, since many of them have application information. It is also worth checking out books about scholarships at your public and school libraries.</p>

	      <p>7. Many companies nowadays will compile lists of colleges that you can browse through or buy. They break down how hard it is to get into, what kind of SAT/ACT score you need, what campus life and academics are like, and what kind of job prospects alumni have upon graduation.</p>

	      <p>8. Contact schools for information. If you contact the schools that you are interested in by signing in on their admissions website, they will probably send you a pile of information about the school. Most schools now have information online. You should do this as early as possible if you are still in high school, because some colleges have unusual apply-by dates or a list of required high school classes. They will send out reminders of important due-dates and information.</p>

	      <p>9. Narrow down your list of schools. By the time you are a Junior in high school, you should be narrowing down the list of schools you want to apply to. It would be a good idea to visit some schools during your Junior year. Decide what college(s) you want to apply to based on the information they sent you, the information you received from other people, and your own reconnaissance.</p>

	      <p>10. By October of your Senior year you should know who you are applying to and what they want in terms of references, test scores, etc. Do not leave this decision until several days before the due date for forms and paperwork. A lot of information may need to be obtained, including references for some colleges.</p>

	      <p>11. It is also important to be certain about your choice and not just apply "for the heck of it" or because everyone else is going to that college.  It needs to suit you and what you want.</p>

	      <p>12. Visit some colleges. Each school is different; some are huge with 30,000 or more students, and some have only a few hundred students. Do you want a city campus or a country campus? North or South? A particular religious group? Go there and look. If you have a friend, or another kid from your high school who goes there, get them to show you around.</p>

	      <p>13. Try to talk to students in various grade levels and ask them for their perspective of the school. Listen to what they have to say, but form your own opinion on what you like and dislike.</p>

	      <p>14. Sit in on a class. Try to imagine what it would be like to be a student there. Can you imagine yourself being happy and living fruitfully there?</p>

		  <h4>Steps 15-27</h4>
				<p>15. Oftentimes, a college will give a visiting student a fee waiver. These can save you $50 or more, plus visiting beforehand can help you decide whether or not you even want to bother applying.</p>

				<p>16. Apply if the college fits you and your interests. This sounds simple, but it is an important consideration. Your choice will effect you for many years down the road. If you feel like a square peg pushing yourself into a round hole, you must evaluate the importance of doing this against the possibility of going to somewhere else that may not be so prestigious or handy but offers you exactly what you want.</p>

				<p>17. Middle tier and top tier schools usually require you to write essays. They expect these essays to be impeccable, thoughtful and creative. Be sure you are unique in expressing yourself, but avoid a level of eccentricity that would be detrimental. There is a lot of advice online about how to write these, so look around and see what other students have done.</p>

				<p>18. Figure out who can write your letters of recommendation. Give them plenty of time to write the letters and keep track of whether they have actually sent them out. You should be thinking well in advance about which teachers you want to write recommendations. And, it isn't a bad idea to do a little extra schmoozing with those teachers to be sure they know you and have something nice to say about you.</p>

				<p>19. Also consider issues related to residency, expenses, quality of final qualifications, scholarship/bursary availability and your own eligibility etc.</p>

				<p>20. Decide whether you want to apply with early admission. Early admission is a way of telling a school that you really want to go there. Pretty much, if they accept you, you're bound to go. (For this reason, you can only apply to one school with early admission).</p>

				<p>21. Early admission has its advantages and disadvantages. If you do apply early admission, you'll have a slightly higher chance of getting in. School use early admission to gauge who ''really'' wants to go to their school; many students who they accept eventually end up going somewhere else, a situation that is not ideal.</p>

				<p>22. The disadvantage of early admission is that if you get accepted, you have no flexibility. You have to go to that school, even if you got a scholarship to a different school, or your best friend was attending a different school. Be sure you're comfortable with the school if you decide to apply early admission.</p> 

				<p>23. Complete most applications by January. Most of the more respected schools require applications to be completed by January of your Senior year. By around April 1st they will tell you whether you are admitted, then you will have to decide by May 1st if you will go there.</p>

				<p>24. For many middle level schools or less selective schools, you can apply at any time and they will tell you in a few weeks whether you are accepted.</p>

				<p>25. There are also schools (but not famous ones) which have empty seats in their Freshman class right up to the start of school in September. So, if you don't get accepted in April, then you can still work on applications and find a school that will take you right up to the start of the Fall term.</p>

				<p>26.Thank the individual(s) who wrote you letters of recommendation. You may have been asked to submit letters of recommendation along with your application. Never forget to thank the people who were willing to write those for you! Without their contribution, your application might not have been accepted.</p>

				<p>27. Once you have been accepted, apply for financial aid (optional). Go directly through the school itself, or apply for FAFSA, a governmental body. Many top tier schools will waive the price of admission if your family's income falls below a certain mark. Talk with your high school guidance counselor if you believe this to be the case.</p>

		<h4>UC VS. CSU</h4>
      <p>One of the differences between UC's and CSU's is that the CSU's have 23 Universities, while the UC's have only 10. UC's were the only public higher education system that could grant students with a Doctorate degree. CSU's mission is to supply undergraduate students through the masters level of insdtruction and is very different from the UC's education system.</p>
      <p>UC's mostly focus on theoretical, philosophical, and research based learning, while CSU's focus on theoretical and practical applications.</p>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>Pros</h3>
					 <h3>Save a lot of money</h3> 
					    <p>Community college can give you a very good education because the professors are only invested in teaching and do not have to do any other research, unlike in most universities. This means that not only would you be getting as good an education as if you were taking a class in a 4 year university but would also be saving a lot of money.</p>
					 <h3>You could live at home</h3>
					    <p>If you are someone looking to save money or just arn't ready to leave home just yet,community college can be a good option.</p>
					 <h3>Smaller class sizes</h3>
					    <p>Having a smaller class size gives you a better opportunity to work more closely with your classmates and professor making the learning process easier for most people.</p>
					 <h3>Could get more one on one time with your professor</h3>
					    <p>Being in a smaller class not only means its easier for you to learn but also it means that you get to know your professor better and interact more with them. This can be specially useful if your looking to get recommendation letters or internships.</p>
					 <h3>Independent Classes</h3>
					   <p>In college and university, you are the one who picks your own classes and make sure they fufill your requirements, taking community college classes can help you transition to this system efficiently.</p>
					 <h3>You can stay with the same group of friends</h3>
					   <p>This can be either a good thing or a bad thing. It is good to be able to see your high school buddies for a while longer but many people become too comfortable with this and become stuck in the same routine for longer than they had originally planned.</p>
					 <h3>Boost your G.P.A</h3>
					   <p>Community college can be a good time to boost your G.P.A.In High school if one of the things that stopped you from going to a 4 year university was a low G.P.A, community college is a good way to get your G.P.A up. Universities you may want to transfer to will only look and consider your grades from community college and not high school.</p>
					 <h3>Flexible schedule</h3>
					   <p>If you work or have to take care of someone else, taking community college classes can easily be made to fit into your schedule the way you need them to.</p>
					 <h3>Give students an opportunity to explore their major</h3>
							<p> In community college you can explore your interest by taking different classes that interest you an figuring out what you might want to make your major.</p>
    </div> 
	  <div data-role="collapsible">
      <h3>Cons</h3>
			  <h3>Impacted classes</h3>
				  <p>Classes in community college are becoming more and more impacted, this means that there is less space in classes and the criteria to get into that class is becoming a bit more strict.</p>
				<h3>Hard to transfer</h3> 
					<p>The transferring process can be quite difficult, specially when you don't have the right information or the correct classes. You need to make a lot of research before actually picking out classes because you want them to be transferable.</p>
				<h3>You don't get the dorm experience</h3>
					<p>One of the things that you might miss out on as a community college student or as a transfer student is the dorm experience. During freshmen year of University people establish relationships with the students at their campus and their dorm.Transfer and CC students don't get to experience this, and some people may feel like they missed out on something.</p>
				<h3>Don't have a lot of class choices</h3>
					<p>Because community college tends to be smaller than Universities, the class choices are less than those of a University.</p>
				<h3>Uninvolved students</h3>
					<p>Community college is a lot less expensive than University that means that students in general tend too be less involved in their studies as university students are.</p>

      <p>Teachers are a good resource whenever you have a question about college. You can go ask your favorite teacher, because even if it might have been a while ago, they had to go through college also. Teachers also have information about clubs or certain classes you may want to take that will help you be more eligible for college. A really good idea is to also take your personal statement to a teacher for proof reading and suggestions on how to improve it.</p>

Other times it's because they think you haven't registered for selective service (the draft), or you entered a number wrong for parents income. At any rate they're usually easy fixes and won't impact chances at receiving aid.</p></li>
								<li>Verification</li>
								<li><p>Providing proof of information you supplied in the FAFSA to financial aid offices at the school you applied to. Usually they ask for verified tax information. When this happens the office will tell you what type of proof they want and it's up to you to send/fax/email it to them. If you get selected for verification, just shrug and send in what they want.</p></li>

    <p>A good way to pay for a university is by getting a loan from your school. It is not the best way because eventually you have to pay it off. Also, an interest rate is added to the money you borrow. A loan is useful in many ways because it helps you pay for your college tuition an it also helps you pay for school supplies. </p>

    <p>Personal statements are essays that are required to apply to any UC and most private schools. You basically have to make yourself stand out and give the administration a reason to choose you.

    <p>What details of your life (personal or family problems, history, people or events that have shaped you or influenced your goals) might help the committee better understand you or help set you apart from other applicants?</p>

    <p>When did you become interested in this field and what have you learned about it (and about yourself) that has further stimulated your interest and reinforced your conviction that you are well suited to this field?</p>

    <p>What insights have you gained?</p>

    <p>How have you learned about this field through classes, readings, seminars, work or other experiences, or conversations with people already in the field?</p>
 
    <p>If you have worked a lot during your college years, what have you learned (leadership or managerial skills, for example), and how has that work contributed to your growth?</p>
 
    <p>What are your career goals?</p>

    <p>Are there any gaps or discrepancies in your academic record that you should explain (great grades but mediocre LSAT or GRE scores, for example, or a distinct upward pattern to your GPA if it was only average in the beginning)?</p>

    <p>Have you had to overcome any unusual obstacles or hardships (for example, economic, familial, or physical) in your life?</p>

    <p>What personal characteristics (for example, integrity, compassion, and/or persistence) do you possess that would improve your prospects for success in the field or profession? Is there a way to demonstrate or document that you have these characteristics?</p>

    <p>What skills (for example, leadership, communicative, analytical) do you possess?</p>

    <p>Why might you be a stronger candidate for graduate school and more successful and effective in the profession or field than other applicants?</p>
